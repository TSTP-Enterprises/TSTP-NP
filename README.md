# TSTP-Network_Password
 A tool to find your saved network passwords in Windows 10/11.


This is the TSTP:Network Password Tool initial commit/release.

This tool allows you to see all saved/stored network passwords on your system without having to navigate through menus or remember where you need to go.  It has an easy to use UI, an easy to follow tutorial that is very quick and to the point, the ability to export the passwords for easy access and transfer, and has a compact mode when you just need to get what you want and get out.

This program is released to the public for free and can be downloaded as an already compiled EXE within a zip at https://www.tstp.xyz/programs/network-password-tool/
